BTC Trading Web Application is a user-friendly platform built with Flask, designed to automate Bitcoin trading strategies with ease. By integrating with Binance's API, the application pulls both real-time and historical Bitcoin market data, enabling users to make data-driven trading decisions.

The web interface allows users to specify key trading parameters, such as the initial investment amount, pruning ratios, and stop-loss thresholds, which serve as the foundation for automated trading strategies. Once the user inputs these parameters, the backend processes the information, executes the defined trading strategy, and continuously monitors the portfolio's performance.

The application provides users with real-time updates on their capital and portfolio value, helping them track their trading performance and make informed adjustments to their strategies. This tool aims to simplify Bitcoin trading, making it accessible to both novice and experienced traders while optimizing their investment strategies with minimal manual effort.
